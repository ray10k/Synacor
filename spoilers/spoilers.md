Spoiler-containing files
========================
The files in this folder contain solutions for several of the major puzzles in this challenge. Do not look unless you want the solutions presented on a silver platter.

- `actions.txt` is a list of actions that are needed to get to the first ending (the Synacor teleporter ending.)
- `actions_modified.txt` is a list of actions that are needed once the binary file has been patched, and lead to the second ending (the True ending of the challenge.)
- `Required modifications` lists a minimal set of changes needed to the binary, in the format of `starting address:new data`. These modifications unlock the True ending.
